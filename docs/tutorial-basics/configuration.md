## Chat Settings 

- Explore this menu to adjust provider attributes, set token limits, refine temperature control, and manage window memory.

### Max Token

- Consider tokens as fragments of words. The API first disintegrate the input into tokens before executing any operation.
- Each model follows a token limit that you can modify according to the anticipated response length and the model you operate on.
- To understand more about tokens, refer to [Tokens by OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).

### Temperature

Representative of the randomness or "creativity" in the text generation, it ranges between 0 and 1. A higher value generates more diverse output, while a lower value sticks closely to the training data. The default value is set at 0.3, with 0 being the most deterministic and 1 being the most random.

For more information about temperature settings, visit [Temperature by Cohere](https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/temperature).

### Window Memory

This tool stores the historical log of your past conversations. However, it only accounts for the last 'K' conversations, ensuring the buffer doesn't exceed the token limit.

- Default: 4
- Minimum: 1
- Maximum: 50
