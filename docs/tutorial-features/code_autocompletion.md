# Autocomplete

## Description
The Autocomplete feature empowers you to choose from a curated selection of models including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Google Makersuite. This advanced tool enhances your coding experience by providing accurate and contextually relevant code suggestions.

## How to Use:
- Go to Autocomplete on CHATWITHTECH Settings:
    - Check the option âœ… **Autocomplete ON**
    - **Provider:**
        - OpenAI - gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
        - CHATWITHTECH Plus - Plus
        - Anthropic - claude-2
        - Anthropic - claude-instant-1
        - Ollama - deepseek-coder:base
        - Ollama - CHATWITHTECH/deepseek-coder-1.3b-typescript
    - **Max Tokens:** The maximum number of tokens to generate. The model will stop once this many tokens have been generated, so this value trades off between latency and coherence.
    -  **Suggestion Delay:** The delay in **milliseconds** between the last character typed and the request for suggestions. By default is 3000.
